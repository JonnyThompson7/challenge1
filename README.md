This is my submission for Module 1 Week 1 Challenge - Code Refractoring the Horiseon website.

I added ID and Classing elements within the HTML in order to condense the CSS page and make easier to follow and navigate. Each section of the HTML page is labeled, as well as every section on the CSS page for the purpose of making it easier to read and navigate.
